        <h2>Case Study: Surviving the PDT Rule</h2>
        <p>
            The Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule in the US requires traders with less than $25,000 in their account to make no more than 3 day trades in a rolling 5-day period. Many new traders get locked out after exceeding this limit.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Lesson:</strong> Always track your day trades and understand your broker's rules.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use swing trades or cash accounts to avoid PDT restrictions.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk:</strong> Violating the rule can result in account restrictions or forced liquidation.</li>
        </ul>
